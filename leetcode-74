Docstring for leetcode-74
Time Complexity: O(logn)

Space Complexity: O(1)
Tip: when using low <= high, the convergence of the binary search ends with low =hihg + 1 . It is up to you what you want to return based on necessity.
Here, since I am using the first column, I am trying to find the el that is closest and smaller than the current target.. thats why I return high in my binary search.

class Solution:
    def searchMatrix(self, matrix: List[List[int]], target: int) -> bool:
        
        columnList = [row[0] for row in matrix]
        print(columnList)

        targetRow = self.binSearch(columnList, target)

        targetIndex = self.binSearch(matrix[targetRow], target)
        print(targetRow, targetIndex)
        return matrix[targetRow][targetIndex] == target
    
    def binSearch(self, nums, key):
        low, high = 0, len(nums) - 1

        while low <= high:
            mid = low + (high - low) // 2

            if key == nums[mid]:
                return mid
            if key > nums[mid]:
                low = mid + 1
            else:
                high = mid - 1
        return high
